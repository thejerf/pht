Programmer HTML Templates: HTML templating for Go that is based on being
convenient for programmers and not developers. It's great and all that
they've got several dozen languages to choose from, but sometimes it's nice
to not have an inner platform and have HTML templating tools available when
you're just a programmer.

One of the cases I use this for is when HTML is an interchange language
moreso than an "output" format; for instance, I format HTML-like tags for
[the Go Graphviz bindings](https://github.com/goccy/go-graphviz) with this.

This repo is still being brought up. The license is valid, but use at your
